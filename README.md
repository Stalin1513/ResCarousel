# ResCarousel
This is Project is based on bootstrap carousel. I have Seen some disadvantage in bootstrap carousel so it started to develope this ResCarousel. I actually developed this for my Online store project.

ResCarousel Means "Responsive Carousel"

<div class="responsiveSlider" data-items="2,4,5,6" data-slide="2">
  <div class="responsiveSlider-inner" >
      <div class="item">
        your item content
      </div>
      <div class="item">
        your item content
      </div>
      ...
      ...
      ...
  </div>
  <button class='btn btn-default leftRs'><i class="fa fa-fw fa-angle-left"></i></button>
	<button class='btn btn-default rightRs'><i class="fa fa-fw fa-angle-right"></i></button>
</div>

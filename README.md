# ResCarousel
This is Project is based on bootstrap carousel. I have Seen some disadvantage in bootstrap carousel so it started to develope this ResCarousel. I actually developed this for my Online store project.

ResCarousel Means "Responsive Carousel"

<div class="responsiveSlider" data-items="2,4,5,6" data-slide="2">
  <div class="responsiveSlider-inner" >
      <div class="item">
        your item content
      </div>
      <div class="item">
        your item content
      </div>
      ...
      ...
      ...
  </div>
  <button class='btn btn-default leftRs'><i class="fa fa-fw fa-angle-left"></i></button>
	<button class='btn btn-default rightRs'><i class="fa fa-fw fa-angle-right"></i></button>
</div>

# About data-items="xs,sm,md,lg" = number

(eg. data-items="2,4,5,6")

data-items is important one in this carousel which defines the no of item to be viewed in a page.

xs - (In mobile size) How many items to be viewed in mobile view

sm - (In tablet size) How many items to be viewed in tablet view

md - (In desktop size) How many items to be viewed in desktop view

xs - (In Large Desktop size) How many items to be viewed in  Large Desktop view

added the looping of the items when it reaches the end

# About data-slide= number

(eg. data-slide="2")

data-slide is important one in this carousel which defines the no of item to be slide in a button click.

# About data-speed = in milli seconds

(eg. data-slide="2")

data-speed is used to control the speed of the moving items

Hope you guys enjoying the Rescarousel

if you find any bug let me know i will try to solve as much as possible
